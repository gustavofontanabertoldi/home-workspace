/*
    The stack is a diferent concept than the line, here the last to come in is
    the first to come out.

    LIFO (Last in, First out);

    We can only add elements at the top of the stack and only have acsses to the top

    To add something to the top we can use:
    -> push

    If we want to remove the element on the top we can use:
    -> pop

    Aplications:
    An exemple of aplication that use a stak is the CTRL + Z
